# Simple Pullback Strategy for TradingView

This is a simple pullback strategy implemented in Pine Script for TradingView. The strategy is designed to identify potential buying opportunities when the closing price is between two moving averages (MA1 and MA2) and certain conditions are met. It also incorporates stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms to manage trades.

## Strategy Overview

The strategy follows these key components:

- **Moving Averages:** Utilizes two moving averages (MA1 and MA2) to identify pullback opportunities.
- **Time Filter:** Allows you to set a specific time range for strategy execution.
- **Exit Conditions:** Includes options for exiting trades based on a lower close, stop-loss, or take-profit conditions.
- **Minimum Time Between Trades:** Ensures a minimum time gap between closing a trade and entering a new one.

1. Copy the entire Pine Script code.
2. Open the TradingView Pine Editor.
3. Paste the code into the editor.
4. Adjust the strategy parameters (MA lengths, stop-loss percentage, take-profit percentage, etc.) as needed.
5. Save and apply the strategy to your TradingView chart.

## Configuration

The strategy is highly customizable through the input parameters. Here are the key parameters you can adjust:

- **MA1 Length:** Length of the long-term moving average (MA1).
- **MA2 Length:** Length of the short-term moving average (MA2).
- **Stop Loss Percent:** Failsafe stop-loss percentage decline.
- **Take Profit Percent:** Take profit percentage gain.
